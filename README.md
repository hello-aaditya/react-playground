# 🎯 react-playground

Practice-based React repo with questions in markdown and topic-wise solutions as separate mini apps.

---

## 🧠 What is this repo about?

This repo is my **React practice playground**.

Instead of just reading theory, I’m:

- Writing **topic-wise questions** in one place  
- Building **small React apps** as solutions  
- Focusing on **core concepts** like state, hooks, props, events, and more  
- Treating this repo like my **React lab** where I experiment and learn by doing

You can think of it as my own **React question bank + solution bank**.
